you never can pass this text but you have a positive attitude, of one you console will call you, and said you pass the text. This is important because the people believe in will pass and when they pass was feel so good, because they this text was so hart, but never to surrender.

when one person go to the hospital and the doctor said to catch an illness, instead of think in all the negative thing like i never been the same person, i will been died, they take a decision of okay is a little illness, will pass end some days, my lives will be a little different, but everything will be good.

The technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Has the limitation of human contact due to use of the technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. in my opinion there are more negative than positive effects about technology

One of a negative effect is. Play games without speaking. We should meet the person first than start to play with that person. instead of play via any web with someone that we do not know who is.

There is another negative effects, kids, and teenagers are able to be in contact with bad people. like kidnappers, this are bad people who take advantages of the technology attacking the most vulnerable in technology the kids make the kids feel confident, and feel they are their friend. there are pedophiles too, looking for kid and teenagers.

Also, because of the technology many frauds are occurring every day hackers stolen some of our personal information. Like our names, address, social security number, banks accounts information, and make frauds to companies.

In conclusion, I believe that the technology has many negatives effects in our social lives

It is bad for our kids, and our information in risk, I wish we could find a safety way to use it.  ",3.0,2.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

Some students think its best to have a healthier lunch and not the same one.

Students always have something different to eat. Some students get bored of eating the same lunch here and there so, why not have a healthier lunch. If the change in the menu where to happen most students would not get bored or complain about their food. Although, one can see that not most of the students enjoy their lunches they mostly just play around with their food on their trays. while some are actual eating.

Some prefer to stay with the same menu. Some would not agree with the change in the lunch menu. However, Others prefer the idea of having the healthier lunch instead of the other lunch menu. On the other hand, Some do not want the change just because of their favorite food on the other menu. But if they try it they might find out hey like something new.

Provides more nutrients. If the cafeteria where to start to give healthier foods in the menu. Students would have the right amount of energy for the rest of the day. This means if they ate a healthier lunch they would not fall asleep for the remainder of class or classes.

In conclusion, the cafeteria should start giving healthier lunch and not whats on the other menu. By the end of the day students would have more energy and be awake in class.                                                          ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,0

I believe that high school student should not allow to graduate in three years. Beacuse for example they are not going to have free time with friends, it's hard for student who learnd new language and some student work afther school. Did you imagen yours child spend all day at school studying hard out seem their parents most of the day just want tham graduate in less then four years.

To begin with, all single child or student need to have free time play with the friends the student don't have to worry about stay afther school to study. most student like afther school go to thier friends houses to play video game, go to eat restaurent also student who graduate in four years don't have to be take any clases during summer or evenings. they can have time to play any sport they like during summer insted of be in at school taking any clases.

In addition for those student who are learning a new language three years is not enought time to learnd every single studnet differnt time to learn some of than learn faster than others student this program that offer that allow high school student graduate in three years,may have to know that each student laern differenly. Anothers disavanges to graduate in three years insted of four is that student don't have time to secand chances to take any felling sol or test they must have to pass each test or sol each years to able to graduate. I feel that is too much prechers for student who learning a new language that they don't have enought time to learn better, that can effect the student when they want to attend to go to callage. It's song that one years can't make any different but,for must of student will be make different,in one years we can prepere student whow callage are what is the different bitween high school classes and callage classes.

The least but list as we know some student work afther school the issue is that this student don't have time to do their homework and study for any test some tham student work fourty hours per week they are going to sleep late night it's hard to attend to school everyday and work at the same time. they just not focus in school they have anothers responsability for example, help their family pay bill or rent so,this student may take the four years to graduate from high school they can do some make up some work and study.

Inconclusion In my opinon the student from high school should not allow to graduate in three years we can keep traditional four years. in this case the student can have more time to play with the friends, time to learn better a new language learn more in high school to be ready for callage and they can have time to help their family with anything this programs should help the student to keep traditional four years the student are future any country may have suppor with are better for them.

People just wanna finish their jobs very fast, and they wanna get where their going really fast,

and that leads to not have a good attitude with others, one of the first reasons is you can get to your dream job, for example if your positive with others they can like you or offer you a deal that's going to change your life for ever, and they may say that your a great person, and they might offer you to come and work in their company or work in a really great passion.

Another reason is you can make someones day or make them happy, for example their having a really bad day and you come and talk to them with a positive attitude, and maybe your going to make them really happy and also that can effect on others if you make them happy they can make others people happy also.

One last reason is Communication, for example by having a positive attitude you can communicate with others, and you can have a good relationship with them and maybe be really good friends.

6,33,036042533396,"Do you ever feel like giving up just because you failed and you feel like nothing is going your way ?

In this paper i will argue that '' success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasms''

Sometimes it's okay to feel upset,mad and frustrated when you think you're trying your best and it seem like. Nothing it's working out for you .

Failure is the way to success and some people seem not okay with it. Most people also don't understand why it has to be like this. However we don't always get what we want in life and that's a fact. Because that's just the way it is you can't blame yourself for it either. Most of us think that you have to be successful the first time you try something. But sadly that's not how works for some of us but some are just lucky.

I remember a few years back when my Aunt Generic_Name open her second beauty salon. She was quite upset because nothing was going the way she wanted to and how she planned. It wasn't going well she felt like everything was falling apart. She started to lose a lot of costumers the first year she open the salon. But 2 years later she started to promote her beauty salon again. She kept trying till she achieved her goals and now everything going well for her. I think one the things that helped her a lot was her positive attitude towards everything. She also didn't lose her enthusiasm. I think this is a good example of ''success consist of failure''

Some of us might not agree that ''Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.''

I know a few people that don't have this mentality. Just because you weren't successful doesn't mean you're not going to be ''somebody''. Or that you need to stop trying because it's not meant for you. But they are wrong because at the end of the day what matters is what you think you're capable of doing and what you can do.

Don't let others people get to you and keep hoping for the better. Another good example is most of the big celebrities that we know now days like Oprah,Ellen DeGeneres and many more were turn down before had disappointments and maybe gave up for a moment . But they never lost their '''enthusiasms'' and they made their dreams come true and pretty much that's how you become successful in life.

From time to time you need to start taking those ''Failures'' as a lesson and just keep trying to do better. Because that's how life is. Because you attempt to do something and it didn't go your way doesn't mean you have to put it aside. We are humans we make mistakes. But you just can't give up easily and losing hope. It's not an option either you just have to keep pushing and like people say ''Fake it till you make it .''

In the future i hope people start realizing that opportunities come and go. There's nothing wrong with failure. I'm pretty sure we all been there before and it's okay to feel like crap. But it's not okay to stop trying just because one door closes many more can open for you. You can go as far as you want to because you're the only one that can stop you from being successful.

7,35,037C88B5B111,"Most of the schools in around the world that cut off hours in school, and they get a good results. Some people say that is the good idea, but some people think that a bad idea depend on their opinion. If they extending the school day two hours, to a four- day school a week, they will give students get more chances to focus what they like, time to explore and spend more time for family. Some of the countries try to improve it and they received a lot of good responds from students and parents recently. New things always have a difference opinion, and so many people could not adapt it, but one day it will bring a revolution to education.

The first thing brought the benefit for this idea is students can able to focus what they like. In the real world, Students have so much things to do. They have to start school at 7am to 2pm, it takes a long period of day and they could not practice what they like. If they can get less hours a day in school so they could practice sports, music,sciences instead of math and English. There must have some students interesting at classes in school and they enjoy it, but they are still force to take classes that they do not like, its not their advantages. Some students would quit school because they could not find out themselves in there, and it will costs a lot of problems into the future especially effects to the next generation. That why schools should give students more hour to get what they like to do.

The problem related to previous the first thing is time for family. Still, students spent all day long in school, and some of them want to do their favorite things after school, then they accidentally forget spend time with their family. ''Family is the root behind success of student'', but when they get home, they have to do their homework at midnight. So many tradition families that have a rule that student have to follow then they do not have time to do their homework. Some of students have a jobs after school to get more benefits, scholarships, to prepare their life in college. Some students just want to support their family and do not have time to think about school. they have to bring their homework everywhere they go. If schools follow a four-day school week, it would be better to students and their family; they can get more time to hangout; they do not need worry about school or test tomorrow. Students can enjoy their time with family.

The important thing that can not miss is time to explore. ''A fish can not claim like a monkey'', some people good at math, some at music or art and we can not take a person good at math to do music. That is exactly going on in school life; students can not find out what they truly want to do; they do not have creative. If school follow a four-day school week, students can receive more extra times to explore the world and life. They could discover nature that teachers can help them, reality could help students get more experiences and discover themselves what they good at. Europe countries like Holland and Ireland had tried this and they got the highest education in the world. In Europe, they do not have homework, students go to school four or five days a week but less hours. that is good thing that every schools in the world should follow.

Eventually, schools and teachers just want do the best for young generation, and they want to make a better life. Sometimes, they should flexible time and give students a chance to focus what they like, family and to explore a life. Students still able to finish their work, only 24 hours a day is not enough for them to complete everything. School, themselves and family, that is a lot of things to do in a day. ''Life is hard, do not make it harder'',

that is a good quote to say. Schools should give students more time.   ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,0

If you don't have good attitude in what we're doing then we can never get the things that we have to do done for for instance if I didn't have a good attitude everytime things got hard I wouldn't have done the things I did. Take for example If I would've had a bad attitude everytime something went wrong in my life I wouldn't be as happy as I am now because we all go through difficult times but how we choose to handlle it is way different.

Take famous people for example if they would've given up everytime people said horrible things to them they wouldn't Have as much money as the do now or famous as they are now. People who don't have good attitudes don't want other people to have success because they wish they had a good enough attitude to do what others are doing. If we decide to have a good attitude we can get more things done and accomplish way more then anyone else.

It's also nice to help other people with they're attitudes. By helping other people we can have way more success it's just simple if we want to accomplish more then we can help people with they're attitudes and help them get way more things done. Another example I have a friend and she didn't have a good attitude about her grades but she didn't want to work hard to improe them so I told her if she wanted to get her gades up she had to have a good attitude about them and she did the she started working harder and she improved so much.

First, technology has a lot of wed-sites which attracted to most people. Therefore, when you walk in the park or wherever you go, you will see most people with their eyes into their phone, ipad, computers or another device. As a result, there are many road accidents or even some parents lose their children in the mall.

Second, students are not productive in their classes. They do not need to read a book, to find the information what they need because everything is in the internet. In other words, technology is more intelligent than our students.

Finally, technology has ended up with our social life. Nobody what to talk with other person without use his phone. In adittion, the comunication between parents and children, can not be possible these days because they are very busy surfing on internet. They spend a lot time in their devices, when they are in the store, in the house, in the work, even in a date.

However, some people think that technology is not bad at all because it help to save people. For example, in a hospital, doctors usually use technology to do X-ray, operations and to test different body part's. This help them to do more professional their work. Also, it help to do many work outside the country. For example, if the government in our country want to send information to an allied country, it will be easier by e-mail.

Have I ever give up in something that I thought never could be success on it? Do I agree with churchill's statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success?

Which is my opinion?

First of all, to me success is to be good at what you do, cooking, driving, boxing, flying, playing sport or teaching it dosn't matter what it is, if you are good on it you are going to be succesful. And yes. I believe that to be success really consists on going from failure to failure withour give up. because sometime we need to know how it feel to fail in order to feel what is success mean. you know. To me those people that didn't work hard, don't know how failure feel like are the one that faster go down, cuz they don't care about it, unti they got there.

My thinking about success, is the that's the best moment of a person who fighting and fighting for what he or she wants withour giving up unti his/her last breath. You know. One year ago when I went to my country, I hear a lot of peaple saying this guy die unhappy cuz he didn't enjoined at all what he work so hard to accomplish. and then the guy who was the death guy bestfriend and partner said. he didn't die unhappy cuz he die doing what he wanted to do all his life. Later I began to think about that ask to myself is really important fight and fight to success in something and I know that everyone there did the same because they all stay quiet for a few secands. And after that. success to me is be good at what you want, fight for it, and be happy.

Since I remenver my family telling me, that the most important things on life are those that you make by you on. You know. My family are very poor people. So when I was like 11 yuears old I deciIde to get a job, so I could buy things like pencil, pen thigs like that and went to my neighbor have a factory of cofe and he pay me like 1 dollar but in dominican money every day. In a few day a lot of pencil, and a began to sell then. I never had to be worrie for those things any more or money for project. I guess that time feel really seccesful I was doing something the really worked.

I have a friend who is now a professional boisboll player, he fail a lot of time the test to be a professional beisboll player because he didn't had what was needed to pass it, and he didn't give up until pass it. He was so happy that they. i have had give up in a lot of things. looking back now that I think about if I will put more enthusiasm on it, maybe I would success.

I gree with winston churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of successs. because I know how it feel fail, and success. I know many people who had afil, and fail, and fail, and then success.

Today people can do a lot of things using technology, but there are some good and bad effects that technology cause on people's lives. Technology can cause bad effects and there are some people that they can see what is technology causing and they just prefer to continue using technology. Technology need limitation for humans.

Although some people says that technology had positive effects on people's lives, actually technology can have negative effects on people's lives because technology cause addiction to peoples. Addiction to technology is a big problem in the world. Some people believe that technology doesn't cause negative effects on people's lives, but this is not true because technology can cause problems on people's lives.

First reason, why does technology had negative effects on people's lives is because technology cause a lot of problem on peoples. One of the problem is that today technology had a big impact on people specially in adults, kids, and adolescents. The majority of people are using technology some of them knows what it can cause if they are using this all the time. For example, some kids start using technology when they just have 4 or 5 years old, and it can cause positive effects and also can cause negative effects because they start learning, but at the same time they are creating a big addiction to cell phones. The parents have to control this and dont give to their kids cell phones because they just are kids and dont need to use technology too much. Kids can use technology to study or have fun, but they need limitation of technology .

Second reason, why does technology cause negative effects on peoples lives is because adolescents are using technology to play online. This is causing a big problem to them because they are getting addiction to this. Some adolescents just prefer to stay at home playing and they dont want to go out with their parents.

The Washington post had a article about the addiction that technology is causing on people's lives. This article says that people who are playing online are having problems with banks. For example, Some of them have to pay to play online. They can't stop playing because they have a addiction. They start using credits card of their parents and they create debt with banks.

16,92,06F368177993,"The Forme British Prime Minister

Churchil,

Once he said ""The success consists of going from failure to failure right but without loss of enthusiasm"",

My oponion about the all this success is basic on Prime Minister Winston Churchill that he once said the success consists if you loss your enthusiasm i think he was exactly what he said about in persuit of success because the enthusiasm consist and how you going to be when you do something that you need to do right so you need to ge a great enthusiam for do it as well rifht if you do not do well its mean that your enthusiasm is what is success is passed from you was a one's of statement about the important role consist.

Some succes too is basic how you are if are good person sometime its mean that you controle a paper that if something is passed on you right that's mean that you need to get attention taht what you going to do in this time so this is one other effects that cause on you so i am agree with churchill's statement, but in the same time we can said its normal right because it how you feel tha's mean is represent your enthusiasm every time that you feel,as great or we said a mad perosn so the success i be comig in this point too becasue your accition is represent you feeling.

About the success that is consist if you going to failure to failure that the Forme British Prime Minister Churchill once said that that's meam if you main is great a or lower you need keep in your main that you going to do well and you need to be strong like one example,that if you think that you not do well you need stay attention that what thing is going to happen in the moment that success is be great or you can faiure too right but ist no mean that you stay with you head dowm right so, basic the Forme British Minister Winston Churchiil said about you think is that you success is not be right o can we said like bed so its mean that you going to failure, if without loss all your enthusiasm so i will said that all success is coming from all that you think and its basic too accion that you well do. Success is basic in what is going to happen bewteen that person accion so its mean that the person and their success it play one paper that you don't or i going to explain as never give up to other thing that just come to all your succes that was some reason you think that your enthusiams is going dowm so its one of importat point that need to show.

The statement about how is such importnat to role that failure plays in pursuit or success is the is that some activity are like pursuit is a important role because failure plays with success its basic that depents some activities that you can do is coming from pursuit right then usually you can see how success is work is basic a important role in this stament because success are principal thinks that each person show when they act then after they actuation so the consists is coming that which its mean that you can failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm i well said thay i am gree with Former British Minister winston Churchill Because the succes is part the us right as i said you need stay as much attetion because enthusiams is be coming that what should that you success is going to be great or youn can lost too in the moment is coming the accion for something that you well do like to said you acction represents off thing that wiil you doing right so is a important role that we can see and each person how pursuit work bewteen the consists like as person can be result, for each statement.
